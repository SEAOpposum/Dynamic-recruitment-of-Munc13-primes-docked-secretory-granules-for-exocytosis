The Molecules copy number analyses were done in N steps:
1. Single EGFP molecules were recorded at high laser power to provoke their bleaching.
2. The Molecules were tracked until their disappearance moment with "TrackNTrace" (https://github.com/scstein/TrackNTrace).
3. The molecule intensities were extracted by the code "TracktracesV2.m"
