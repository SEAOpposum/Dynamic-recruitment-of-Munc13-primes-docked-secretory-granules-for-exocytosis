# The following steps were performed to get the conversion value of the EGFP intensity into molecule copy number
# 1. Single EGFP molecules were recorded at high laser power to provoke their bleaching.
# 2. The Molecules were tracked until their disappearance moment with "TrackNTrace" (https://github.com/scstein/TrackNTrace).
# 3. The molecule intensities of every video were extracted by the code "TracktracesV2.m"
# 4. They were manually concatenated in a file called DFALL.xlsx
# 5. The values were fitted either with Origin or R to a single Gaussian distribution-
#  The R code for the batch Gaussian fitting is "GausianFitandDFcalculation.R"
# 6. Later, these values are used in the exocytosis analysis to estimate the molecule copy number at granules
